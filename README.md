# DBN (Databento Binary Encoding) for Elixir

This is super early WIP, and not ready for distribution.
Please don't use this.

## Installation

If [available in Hex](https://hex.pm/docs/publish), the package can be installed
by adding `dbn` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:dbn, "~> 0.1.0"}
  ]
end
```
